# Tinder (**üõ†Ô∏è In Progress**)
Tinder is a large-scale, location-based social matching platform that connects users through profile swiping and mutual interest. The system must support millions of daily active users, real-time matching, geographically-aware recommendations, and secure, scalable media storage.

## 1. Requirements
### Functional Requirements:
1. Users should be able to log in using their phone number via OTP (One-Time Password).
2. Users should be able to log in with social accounts (e.g., Google, Apple).
3. Users should be able to create and update their profile, including name, gender, bio, interests, etc.
4. Each user should have exactly one profile linked to their account.
5. Users should be able to receive a stack of nearby profiles based on location, preferences, and swipe history.
6. Users should be able to swipe left (dislike) or right (like) on other user profiles.
7. Users should be able to chat in real time with matched users.
8. Users should be notified of new matches, messages, and system events via push notifications.
9. Users should be able to share and update their current location to enable proximity-based recommendations.

### Non-functional Requirements:
1. The system should be able to serve millions of daily active users and scale horizontally under high load.
2. The system should target API response times under 300ms (95th percentile) for core operations.
3. Real-time interactions (e.g., chat, swipes, match notifications) should be processed with low latency.
4. Services should be loosely coupled using event-driven architecture (e.g., Kafka) and independently deployable.
5. The system should scale to handle a high write throughput, e.g., 10 million users √ó 100 swipes per day = 1B swipe events/day.
